        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It helps in organizing code, improving reusability, and enabling modular programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has a state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- 1.Abstraction hides complexity by showing only relevant details.\n",
        "2.Encapsulation hides internal data by wrapping it inside classes and restricting access using access modifiers (like _ or __).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (double underscore), like __init__, __str__, __len__, are special methods used to customize object behavior in built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent), promoting code reuse and logical hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. For example, method overriding and operator overloading demonstrate polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python, an object-oriented programming concept, is achieved primarily through conventions and some language features, rather than strict access modifiers found in languages like Java. It involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is a class, and controlling access to these internal details.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object of a class. When an object is instantiated, this method is automatically invoked to set up the initial state of the object.\n",
        "ex- __init__\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, class and static methods are special types of methods within a class that differ in how they interact with the class and its instances.\n",
        "Class method: Uses @classmethod and accesses class-level data using cls.\n",
        "Static method: Uses @staticmethod, does not access instance or class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods within the same class that share the same name but differ in their parameters (either by number or type).\n",
        "This allows a single method name to perform different actions based on the arguments provided when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding is when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- A property decorator in Python, denoted by @property, is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods within a class that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in object-oriented programming is crucial because it allows for increased flexibility, code reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms or implementations, making the code more adaptable and easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that contains abstract methods (methods without implementation) and cannot be instantiated. Defined using ABC module and @abstractmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Advantages of OOP are as follows\n",
        "Modularity\n",
        "Reusability\n",
        "Scalability\n",
        "Maintainability\n",
        "Real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class Variable:\n",
        "Defined at the class level, accessible by all instances of the class.\n",
        "Only one copy of the class variable exists for the entire class, and it's shared among all objects.\n",
        "Can be accessed using the class name or an object of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variable:\n",
        "Defined within a class, but associated with a specific instance (object).\n",
        "Each instance of the class has its own independent copy of the instance variable.\n",
        "Can only be accessed through an object of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a single child class can be derived from two or more base classes, gaining access to the functionalities defined in all of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (also known as \"dunder methods\" for their double underscores) that define how an object is represented as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python.\n",
        "- The super() function in Python holds significant importance in the context of object-oriented programming and inheritance. Its primary role is to provide a mechanism for a subclass to access methods and attributes of its parent (or super) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python, also known as the destructor, holds significance in object-oriented programming primarily for resource cleanup when an object is about to be garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @classmethod-\n",
        "Takes the class itself (cls) as its first argument.\n",
        "Can access and modify class-level attributes and call other class methods.\n",
        "Often used for \"factory methods\" that create instances of the class with specific configurations, or for methods that operate on class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod-\n",
        "Does not take any specific first argument (neither self nor cls).\n",
        "Cannot access or modify instance-specific or class-specific data directly.\n",
        "Functions like a regular function placed within the class namespace for logical grouping.\n",
        "Ideal for utility functions that are related to the class but do not depend on its state or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python, when combined with inheritance, primarily functions through method overriding. This allows objects of different classes, all derived from a common base class, to respond to the same method call in a way specific to their own class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is a technique in Python (and many other languages) where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code.\n",
        "Each method in the chain returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python serves the purpose of making instances of a class callable, meaning they can be treated and invoked like functions.\n",
        "When a class defines a __call__ method, any object created from that class can be directly called using parentheses, similar to how a function is called."
